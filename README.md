I have come across a problem. This is different to the problem I emailed you about when talking about the extension (I solved that problem).  When I enter the short forms I get a message box saying "Length cannot be less than zero, Parameter name: Length". Before my program was working until I added the  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) for the translations however I'm not sure if this is the sole problem because I added alot more translations before testing(I deleted them and still get the message box). Also another problem is that the ELSE statement always runs regardless if the IF statement is true... which is strange. Any Ideas? Thank you
